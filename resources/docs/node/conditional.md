type: conditional
name: If-Else
example: '1 == 2 ? 5 : 6'
---

The **if-else block** or **conditional** will give you the first item it
contains if its condition is true, and the second item otherwise.

```javascript
1 == 2 ? 5 : 6
```

The condition can be as simple or complex as you want, as long as it evaluates
to a boolean.

```javascript
true ? 3 : 2
```
```javascript
((3 + 2 - 3) == 2 || false) ? 3 : 2
```
