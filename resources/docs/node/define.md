A **define** represents the definition of a new function. It gives a name to a
function, so that you can refer to it by name later. 

You can drag them into the "definitions" box in the bottom right to put them in the
global scope.

```javascript
function identity(x) { return x; }
```

Functions can take multiple arguments and have complex logic.

```javascript
function max(x, y) { return (x > y ? x : y); }
```

Or, they can be simple.

```javascript
function star() { return STAR; }
```
