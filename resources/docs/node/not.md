The **not** represents an operator that switches the truth value of a boolean
expression. Therefore, not true is false, and not false is true.

The following would evaluate to false.

```javascript
!true
```

The following would evaluate to true.

```javascript
!false
```

Nots can also be used in conjunction with conditional expressions.

```javascript
!_ ? 3 : 4
```
