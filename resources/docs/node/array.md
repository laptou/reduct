**Arrays** are a data structure that provide sequential storing of multiple values
of the same type.

For example, you could have an array of integers.

```javascript
[1,2,3]
```

Here is an empty array that could contain elements of any type.

```javascript
[]
```

Or, an array could contain booleans.

```javascript
[true, false, true]
```

Note: in most programming languages, it is convention to refer to the element
in the first position of the array as the element at position zero. Accordingly,
the element at the end of the array is at the position of the length of
the array - 1.

For example, in the above array, the element at position 0 is true, and the
element at position 2 is also true.
