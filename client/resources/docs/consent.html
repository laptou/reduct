  <strong>Reduct is part of an education research project</strong>

  <p>
    For the first time this year, the Reduct game is used in combination with
    the CASE exam to help make CS placement decisions. The Cornell Future of
    Learning Lab is studying how games compare to traditional exams for
    placement decisions. We are asking for your permission to use your data for
    this research project led by Prof. Rene Kizilcec in Cornell Information
    Science.

<p>
  <b>About this study:</b> The purpose of this research is to compare studentsâ€™
  performance and experience on the CASE exam vs. Reduct, and which one is more
  predictive of how they do in CS courses. We hope to learn about how to make
  accurate and fair placement tests. There are no risks from participating in
  this research.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Voluntary participation:</b> Participation is <em>voluntary</em> and
  <em>not compensated</em>. You can use Reduct for your CS placement,
  <em>independent of whether you decide to give your consent for having your
  data used in this research study </em>. You can contact the research team at
