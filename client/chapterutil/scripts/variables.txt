On this level, the toolbox at the bottom of the screen holds something new. The x and y
are called variables. They are just names that stand for something else. The letters
x and y are gray because right now they don't stand for anything.
A variable can only be used as part of a function whose input has the
same name. Then it flashes green to show that it is a name for the input.
Outside that function, the variable doesn't mean anything, so it stays gray.

Idea:
Split out to show that you can use variables to build functions.

Then explain in a followup video what happened and introduce the name "variable".
Could explain scoping issue here or in a third video
