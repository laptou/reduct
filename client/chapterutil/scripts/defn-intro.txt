The red block is a definition. It lets you create a permanent name for
something. This block allows you to define the name "star" to mean a star. A
definition in the middle of the board doesn't do anything. To turn a definition
on, you have to drag it to the upper left corner. You can also click on the
left side of the screen to see all the definitions on a level.
