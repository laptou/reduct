This gray box you were just playing with is called a function. A
function is like a box you can drop things into. When you drop
something into a function, something comes out.  The thing you drop in is called
the input.  It has a name. For this function the input is named x. The
right side of the function tells you what comes out. The thing that
comes out is called the output. For this function, the output is the
same as the input; whatever you drop into the function comes back out.

Here's another function. No matter what input you drop into this function, you get a star
back as output.
